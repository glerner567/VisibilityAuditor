# Geotab Visibility Auditor v1.6

A custom MyGeotab Add-In designed to audit and visualize group-based security and asset visibility. This tool helps administrators understand exactly which assets a user can see through the group hierarchy and which other users have visibility over them.

## 🚀 Features

- **Inherited Visibility**: Automatically calculates visibility through the entire Geotab group tree (Parent -> Child).
- **Asset Deep Links**: Lists all visible assets with direct clickable links to the vehicle profile in MyGeotab.
- **System Filtering**: Automatically filters out system service accounts (like `myadmin*`) to focus on human users.
- **Two-Way Audit**:
    - **Assets & Users They See**: Displays what the selected user's permissions allow them to access.
    - **Users Who Can See Them**: Displays which other users have overlapping or higher-level group memberships.
